light brown

yeah i know it wasnt perfect but it was damn nice.

thats when you said that you hate me damn it really hurt me.

course its my fault i guess, maybe im just a bully
cause all the love i gave just comes out like i hate you


yeah i hope you know when i called you a loser i meant i really loved you


i really shoulda known that it was fucked but i cant blame myself too much



we were together girl you know that wasnt the first time. and if you hated it so much then why you play
into it so damn much, that smile on your face told a different story.

liiight brown, i never liked that color. but it was pretty on you.

i never wanted to say it, but its not my choice no more. tonight until i die, its goodbye
